# python_password_project
The password_generator.py file can be ran to generate 3 types of password:
- A password with any character (select by entering in 0)
- A password that uses only numbers (select by entering in 1)
- A password that uses no special characters (select by entering in 2)

The user is asked to enter in how many characters they want there password to be

The user is asked what there password is for so it can be recorded in a save file

The password is then saved to a .txt file named passwords.txt and is printed on screen

Run the python script agian and it will save to the new password to the same passwords.txt file without overwriting the old password

Example run for a password 10 characters long that uses any characters:

Welcome to python password generator 

Please enter a password type (normal = 0; number only = 1; and no special
 characters = 2): 0
 
Enter password length: 10
 
Your password is: cR_9_SEJx5 

Thank you for using the password generator
